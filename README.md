# Abstract

Erno Rubik is the inventor of the popular puzzle known as the Rubik’s Cube. One of
the most well-liked gadgets ever is this one. Additionally, the Rubik’s cube’s math is
impressive.Group Theory is the basis for each and every solved cube. How they are
aligned and permuted can be determined by the group theory. This paper explores
the mathematics underlying the Rubik’s cube solve as well as how the cube functions
as a group
